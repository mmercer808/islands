# Signbook Guidelines

The signbook is *not* a backlog and not a diary. It's a persistent, searchable wall of:
- signatures
- discoveries
- aphorisms that actually change how the system is built
- small, real code nuggets

## What belongs here
- design invariants (“Agents propose; one writer commits.”)
- elegant fixes
- links to artifacts and commits
- short keeper “lore” if it encodes a system truth

## What does not
- long planning (put it in docs or TODO)
- repeated status updates
- anything you wouldn’t want rediscovered later

## Format
We keep entries append-only, with:
- signature
- timestamp
- context (optional)
- message
- checksum (optional but encouraged)
