# Agent Roles

- Builder: creates content artifacts (characters/locations/items)
- Mechanic Inventor: proposes new systems (with tests/validators)
- Keeper: proposes plot gravity and repairs
- Merge Agent: simulates merges, runs validator suites, recommends outcomes

All roles produce artifacts, not just chat.
